# Fourier-Transformer

This C++ code can create a frequency spectrum from a time domain signal using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.

It outputs the data as 2 columns: time and amplitude in 'Fx.txt'; frequency and amplitude in 'Gk.txt'. 
I have then been plotting this data with gnuplot to view the time and frequency domain signals.
